Below, you can find the description of your second assignment. Additionally,
you can also find the expected output of this assignment in the Application
Walkthrough section.
Accordingly, you are required to develop a Hotel Reservation System, where you
will be generating Reservation items and display the information that they
hold. Every Reservation should also include the overall cost (payment due).
For this purpose, you are asked to create a Reservation class that includes
hotelName stored in a String, reservationMonth stored in a String,
reservationStart day stored in an int, reservationEnd day stored in an int, and
dailyCost stored in an int variable. Furthermore, your class should have a
displayInfo() method, which would display the information about the
Reservation; and call the calculateTotalPrice() method that calculates the total
amount a customer will have to pay for their Reservation. You should create a
Reservation object and insert all the data via its constructor. Also when you are
displaying the information all information should be collected via getter
methods. Your implementation must be constructed as two separate java files.
For simplicity purposes, reservationStart and reservationEnd variables should
represent the days in a month, while the reservationMonth variable should
describe the months in a year. Hence, as part of this assignment, you should
assume that the maximum possible reservation period is 30 days - e.g. If
reservationMonth is April, reservationStart day is 3 and reservationEnd day is
21, then you should infer that the customer has made a reservation at the
hotel from April 3 till April 21, for a total of 18 days. 
You should create few Reservation objects and show their information and their
total cost by implementing a menu as shown below;
1. Create new Reservation
2. Display all Reservations

PS: You can use basic C-style arrays.
